# roll-dice
A simple program which simulates rolling a die/dice using the random module in Python.

## Rolling Dice How-To:
1. Copy code into any IDE supporting Python.
2. The random module should automatically be imported through the 'import random' statement.
3. Run code, it will automatically roll the first dice, you can than select if you would like to roll again.
- For the question that contains (y/n), answer using y or n. y = Yes, n = No.
